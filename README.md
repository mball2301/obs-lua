# obs-lua
The OBS Lua repo will be used to put lua scripts that I have create/modified for use with OBS Studio https://obsproject.com

Current Index:
refresh-browser-specific.lua - Will refresh the browser that is part of a scene in the OBS studio preview scene (studio mode).   
                               I use this to trigger PTZOptics cameras presets using the cgi command set from PTZOptics.  I only 
                                  want to trigger the preset in the active window when I am using a same camera fade.  If I trigger
                                  it in the preview window it moves it in the active window (same camera).  For this reason I need to
                                  be able to trigger camera source sometimes in the preview scene (stage) and sometimes in the active 
                                  scene.
